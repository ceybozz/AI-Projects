## 🧭 Projects Included

### 1. 🌐 A* Maze Algorithm

An implementation of the **A\*** (A-star) pathfinding algorithm in a grid-based maze.

**Key Features:**
- Heuristic search with Manhattan distance
- Visual representation of explored vs final path
- Start, goal, and obstacle detection
- GUI-based maze visualization (e.g., Pygame or Tkinter)

📁 Folder: `a_star_maze_algorithm`  
📄 Main script: `main.py`  
📑 [Project README](a_star_maze_algorithm/README.md)

### 2. 🧠 AI – Wumpus World

A logic-based AI agent that navigates the classic Wumpus World using inference rules.

**Key Features:**
- Percept-based reasoning (stench, breeze, glitter)
- Rule-based decision making
- Arrow shooting mechanics and gold detection
- Optional GUI for the grid world

📁 Folder: `ai_wumpus_world`
